        # We have added a lot of records. Because wildcard DNS records at the root of a non-empty
        # subtree do only apply at the level that they have been defined at (and not below, see
        # https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4592#section-3.3.1), some wildcards will have their scope
        # limited due to the presence of other rule records at lower level. PSL rules, however,
        # apply to all their subnames (until it collides with a more specific rule).
        # 
        # To take this into account, we apply the following steps for each record:
        # 
        # - First, add a child wildcard record (*.<record>), so that the rule defined by the record
        #   also applies to all subnames. (If <record> is already a wildcard, we skip this step.)
        # 
        # - We then start traversing the tree upward, adding more child wildcard records along the
        #   way. The first of these extends the rule of the parent to all sister names of <record>
        #   which do not have an explicit rule defined.
        #   If we find that the intermediate name itself does not have an explicit role, we also
        #   add an explicit link to its direct parent. This is necessary because the node, being an
        #   intermediate name without records ("empty non-terminal"), does actually exist on the
        #   DNS level and would therefore shadow any higher-level wildcard. For details, see
        #   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4592#section-2.2.2.
        # 
        # - We then repeat the previous step for each remaining level towards the root of the tree.
        #   Each step causes the rule of the next-higher level to take effect on the current level.
        # 
        # - Once names with single labels (like "com") have been processed, we stop. All undefined
        #   sister names are already covered by the "*". rule.
        # 
        # Example: "s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com" leads to multiple rule chains:
        # 1) *.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com --> s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
        # 2) *.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com --> dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
        #    --> eu-west-1.amazonaws.com --> amazonaws.com --> com
        # 3) On each level of 2, we also need a wildcard that serves as a lateral entrypoint.
